=head1 NAME

Yxes::Memcached - Cache::Memcached::Fast wrapper

=head1 VERSION

 0.04

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  [ use the defaults and simply use ]

  use Yxes::Memcached;
  
  my $mem = Yxes::Memcached->new;

     $mem->set('MYVAR' => 'myval');
  my $var = $mem->get('MYVAR');

  [ and/or use this as you would Cache::Memcached::Fast ]

  use Yxes::Memcached;

  my $mem = Yxes::Memached->new({
		servers => [ { address => 'localhost:11211', weight => 2.5 },
			     '192.168.254.2:11211' }],
		namespace => 'my:',
		connect_timeout => 0.2,
		...
   });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package is just a wrapper around Cache::Memcached::Fast and is used
to give us a default location for a memcached server.  We do this 
by simply setting the default server to 'memcached' at the default
port '11211'.  It's your job to be sure that 'memcached' is set in
the hosts file to point to a real IP number.  The idea is to make
it very easy to move the memcached server to a new location and
just update the 'hosts' file without having to find all the
scripts on your machine that use your server.


=head2 new

Use the same way you would Cache::Memcached::Fast

 Optional Attributes:

 - servers => [ { address => 'host:port', weight => #.## },
                'host:port' }]
 - namespace => 'name:'
 - connect_timeout => #.#

the default server is added as 'memcached:11211' and can be
set in your /etc/hosts file

=cut

sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my @args = @_;

  # if they specifically defined servers we'll use that.
    push (@args, 'servers', [DEFAULT_SERVER]) if (!grep /servers/, @args); 
    
$class->SUPER::new({@args});
}

=head1 EXAMPLES

=head2 HOSTS

in your /etc/hosts file 

=over 4

=item * assuming your memcache server runs on your local machine

 127.0.0.1 localhost memcached

=item * otherwise the IP it does run on

 192.168.12.34 memcached

=back

=head2 PROGRAM

The server is the part that we want to default this case so 
canonically just state:

=over 4

 use Yxes::Memcached;

 my $mem = Yxes::Memcached->new();

=back

You can of course add any attributes that are accepted by
Cache::Memcached::Fast as part of your new call and leave
out the servers portion.

=over 4

 use Yxes::Memcached;

 my $mem = Yxes::Memcached->new({
		namespace => 'my:',
		close_on_error => 1,
		max_failures => 3
           });

=back

As part of testing you may want to point to a different
server entirely...

=over 4

 use Yxes::Memcached;

 my $mem = Yxes::Memcached->new({
		servers => [ { address => '/path/to/unix.sock', noreply => 1 } ]
	   });

=back

=head1 TODO

This doesn't address using multiple servers with your memcached server.  To do that
I would recommend having your scripts read from a universal configuration file.

=head1 BUGS

This sucks if you want to access a socket file instead of an IP 
and port.

=head1 SUPPORT

none, nada, zilch... good luck
